# OakSpot - A effective pomodoro App that helps you makes friends while studying
## Inspiration
Nowadays, as students, we need to spend a lot of time on campus to handle many assignments and prepare for upcoming exams. However, we donâ€™t have enough motivation to get things done effectively, and although we value our education, we still feel lonely in this academic journey. Oakspot is here to help.

## What it does
Oakspot is a mobile application assisting students in finding compatible study spots and companions based on their preferences. By using Oakspot, students will be more productive a Pomodoro timer will be activated once a person has settled their study in one of the study spots. Team mode also helps students to collaborate to learn from each other, enriching a friendship and a diverse social life besides school work.

## How we built it
We used Python as our main programming language for backend implementation. We also utilized Figma and Canva for better presentation and delivery.

## Challenges we ran into
Being first-year students with limited programming experience, we couldn't utilize many languages and structures to fully meet our expectations. However, we managed to try our best and did make some progress during the day.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having utilized the fundamental graph structure from our first-year introductory computer science course.

## What we learned
We realized that programming is a long journey to go. As first-year students, we still have many things to do to conquer it. This opportunity in the hackathon motivated us to keep chasing our goals on CS and other aspects.

## What's next for OAKSPOT
We will learn more about the backend frameworks and fully implement the back end using Flask. We will use React to implement the front end of the application for cross-platform development. Moreover, we will complete our desired features and scale the app up so that any study spots, even the hidden ones, will be included. We will also allow students or staff to make real-time updates so that the data about the study spot will be more accurate.
